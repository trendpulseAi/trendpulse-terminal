## 🧠 What is TrendPulse AI?
TrendPulse is a proprietary **Market Scanning Engine** that connects directly to MetaTrader 5 (MT5) institutional feeds. It processes price action in real-time to detect:
- **Vector Flow Misalignments** (Trend Exhaustion)
- **Micro-Structure Breakouts** (Sniper Entries)
- **Volume Anomalies** (Smart Money movement)

Instead of lagging indicators, TrendPulse provides a **Live Dashboard** with a calculated "Win Probability" for every signal.
